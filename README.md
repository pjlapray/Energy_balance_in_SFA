abstract="Multispectral imaging permits to capture more spectral information on object surface properties than color imaging. This is useful for machine vision applications. Transmittance spectral filter arrays combined with a solid state sensor form an emerging technology used for snapshot acquisition. In spectral filter arrays technology, the sensitivities of the camera have critical consequences, not only on applications, but also in the viability of the system. We discuss how to balance the energy of each channel in single exposure multispectral imaging.",
